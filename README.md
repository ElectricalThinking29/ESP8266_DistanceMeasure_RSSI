# ESP8266_DistanceMeasure_RSSI
This project include 2 smaler projects: The WifiAP and the Client. The WifiAP will broacast it's Wifi to the Client. 
The Client will measure the RSSI and convert it to distance.
The Client board I used is ESP8266 Mini, and the WifiAP board I used is ESP8266 Node MCU. 
Though, you can switch in reverse or use both ESP8266 mini or Node MCU because they use the same chip.

# Discription
+ After loading the code, the ESP8266 that loaded the Client's program will start the calibration. Follow the instruction send via COM port that the board is connecting.
+ The calibration includes 2 steps:
  + Step 1: Place 2 board exactly 1 meter apart then press '1' to start the calibration.
  + Step 2: Place 2 board exactly 0.5 meter (50 cm) then press '1' to continue the calibration.
+ The result is not greate. Error can go up to over 70 % as the picture below. So basicly, this project is just for fun.

+ These projects are made on VS Code and PlatformIO.
