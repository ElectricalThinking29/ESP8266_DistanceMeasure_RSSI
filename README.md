# ESP8266_DistanceMeasure_RSSI
This project include 2 smaler projects: The WifiAP and the Client. The WifiAP will broacast it's Wifi to the Client. 
The Client will measure the RSSI and convert it to distance.
The Client board I used is ESP8266 Mini, and the WifiAP board I used is ESP8266 Node MCU. 
Though, you can switch in reverse or use both ESP8266 mini or Node MCU because they use the same chip.
